PyAWS README

Kun Xi <bookstack@gmail.com>

This project aims to eliminate the gap between the latest Amazon Web Service and the pyamazon module. Since Amazon still maintains the old calling convention, PyAWS just forked from the pyamazon-0.65, and most core functions are based on Mark Pilgrim and Michael Josephson's hardwork.

1. Overview

The short-term goal of this project:
    Fully support of Amazon E-Commerce Service, including:
        Item operations
        Cart operations
        List operations
        Help...
    Clearly expressed extension support. All runtime error is mapped to appropriate extension
    Developer-friendly interface. 
        Default parameter just works out of the box
        Developer can tweak the parameter for advance use
    Low-level XML file is also exposed to the programmer, for XSLT-enthusiasts.

The long-term goal would cover all other premium service, if we can collect enough funding to support our debugging. :-)
    
2. API in a Nutshell

The APIs fall into two categories: Python object and raw XML. For example, ItemLookup would return the python object while XMLItemLookup would just return the XML queried from amazon.com. Currently implemented functions:
    ItemLookup
    ItemSearch

TODO:
    Add more options to ItemLookup -- done
    Add pagedIterator support -- done
    Check the correctQuery response.
    More test cases for exceptions
    Ecommerce.foo exception handling.
NOTE: we are not going to wrap the ItemLookup in a class, considering the overhead of self object.

3. Usage -- TODO
Before this section is complete, you could take a look at tests/ for more details about PyAWS in action.
